Project Plan
--------

Project Title: Motion Pong


Project Description:

Motion Pong will utilize the DE2 board, as well as two different ultrasonic sensors, to not only allow players to play the good old fashioned game of Pong but to enable players to utilize simple hand gestures to control their in-game movements. Players will be able to use the distance between their hands and the sensors to do this, moving their hands towards and away from the sensors to move the game paddle up and down respectively, thus, adding another layer of interaction between them and the game they all know and love. 


What is your plan for the first week?
	Add animation, player movements and attempt to get the game of pong functional. 

What is your plan for the second week?
	Add sensor functionality, enabling it to be able to determine the distance between an object (hand) and the sensor. 

What is your plan for the third week?
	Merge the sensors with the game to allow player movement based on the sensor input. 

What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned?
	We will shift our primary focus on pong and add scorekeeping.


Weekly Reports
--------------
*** July 12th, 2019 ***

- DONE:
	- Worked on connecting HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to DE2 board via breadboard
		- Created verilog module to decode and display signals from the HC-SR04 
		- Got basic input/output working with "trigger" and "echo" signals
	- Worked on getting the animation functional
		- Got the plotting and "erasing" or pixels functional with a delay counter
		- Get the pixel animated moving back and forth

- TO-DO:
	- Implement ratedivider for ultrasonic sensor
	- Calculate distance based on time intervals for "trigger" and "echo" signals
	- Extend the animation to be able to move a ball around the screen
	- Collision detection
	- Player paddles and their input


*** July 19th, 2019 ***

- DONE:
	- Worked on getting the animation working and the basic game of pong functional
		- Added the paddles and ball
		- Added animation
		- Added movement from user input with the buttons and switches
	- Worked on getting the sensors set up and translating them to user inputted distance
		- Connected the sensors successfully
		- Added a distance function that translated the sensor input to distance
	- Connected the sensors to the paddles, allowing sensor inputted movement in the game; still WIP
- TO-DO:
	- Get all the different parts of the game into a single package that functions as the game of Pong should
	- Add collision detection to the ball and paddles
	- debug issues with controlling the paddles via ultrasonic sensors
	- Smoothen out bugs and other hiccups
	- Testing


*** July 26th, 2019 ***

- DONE:
	- Worked on the collision detection
		- Added collision detection to the paddles
		- Added ball respawn when hitting the walls
		- Added point increment during wall collision
	- Worked on paddle movement
		- Added ultrasonic sensors to the paddles
		- Smoothened the movement from the jittery ultrasonic sensor input
		- Testing done
	- Added a point system
		- Added correct point system to keep track of points on the HEX
	_ Added different speeds and colour customixability to the ball and paddles
		- The game speed can be altered
		- Colour of balls and paddles can be changed separately
	- Shoot the video presentation for the project
_ TO-DO:
	- Add a splash screen that disappears after game start
	- Add the points on the screen itself instead of on the HEX
	- Add an end-game screen of which player won
	- Rainbow mode?
	- Edit video presentation and upload



*** August 2nd, 2019 ***
-DONE:	
	- Finished the points system
	- Finished the end game splash screen
	- Removed title screen when the game begins
	- RAINBOW mode
	- Finished video presentation
