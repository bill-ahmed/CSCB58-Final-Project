Project Title: Motion Pong


Project Description:

Motion Pong will utilize the DE2 board, as well as two different ultrasonic sensors, to not only allow players to play the good old fashioned game of Pong but to enable players to utilize simple hand gestures to control their in-game movements. Players will be able to use the distance between their hands and the sensors to do this, moving their hands towards and away from the sensors to move the game paddle up and down respectively, thus, adding another layer of interaction between them and the game they all know and love. 


What is your plan for the first week?
	Add animation, player movements and attempt to get the game of pong functional. 

What is your plan for the second week?
	Add sensor functionality, enabling it to be able to determine the distance between an object (hand) and the sensor. 

What is your plan for the third week?
	Merge the sensors with the game to allow player movement based on the sensor input. 

What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned?
	We will shift our primary focus on pong and add scorekeeping.
